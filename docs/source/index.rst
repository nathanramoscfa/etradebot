ETradeBot
#########

ETradeBot is an automated trading software written in Python for E-Trade accounts that allows users to execute trades
based on custom trading strategies. ETradeBot is strategy-agnostic and will execute any strategy given to it. Schedule
a `FREE consultation <https://calendly.com/nrcapitalmanagement/etradebot>`_ to learn more or discuss how ETradeBot can
fit into your trading strategy.

.. warning:: ETradeBot is experimental software and is in early development. Test on small dollar accounts only. This
   project is not affiliated with E-Trade or any other financial institution. By using ETradeBot, you agree to the
   `disclaimer <https://etradebot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/disclaimer.html>`_. The developer is not responsible for any
   losses incurred from the use of ETradeBot. Use at your own risk.

Features
========

-   Fetches real-time market data from the E-Trade API
-   Accesses market data from the Bloomberg API or Yahoo Finance API
-   Executes trade types: buy, sell, sell short, and short cover
-   Submits price type: market orders to E-Trade API
-   Manages portfolio: tracks positions, balance, and performance
-   Trades: common stocks and ETFs

The Bloomberg API requires a Bloomberg Terminal subscription, however, the Yahoo Finance API is free to use. ETradeBot
will automatically use the Yahoo Finance API if the Bloomberg API is not available.
